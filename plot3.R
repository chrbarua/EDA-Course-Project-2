# Question: Of the four types of sources indicated by the type\color{red}{\verb|type|}type (point, nonpoint, onroad, nonroad) variable, 
# which of these four sources have seen decreases in emissions from 1999â€“2008 for Baltimore City?

# Answer: The non-road, nonpoint, and on-road sources decreased emissions overall from 1999 to 2008, whereas point increased.
